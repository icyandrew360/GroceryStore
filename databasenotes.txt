For the database, we need:

ITEMS table:
Contains name, stock (INT)

USERS table:
Contains email, firstname, lastname, password, address

ADMINS table:
are users. references users from the USERS table. 
Will contain the same tuple variables as USERS table.
admins will be able to add stock to the database straight
from the web app.
